# Sensor Things API

The [SensorThings API (STA)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/sensorthings/) provides an open, geospatial-enabled and unified way to interconnect the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, observation data, and applications over the Web. 

SensorThings API is an implementation of the Observations Measurements and Observation UML model.

## The SoilWise efforts on this topic focus on:

- Design, test and document approaches to share soil observation data using STA
- How can users [visualize STA data in QGIS software](https://docs.qgis.org/3.40/en/docs/user_manual/working_with_ogc/ogc_client_support.html#sensorthings) (to highlight the benefit of interoperable approaches) (and how can users populate Soil GeoPackage from QGIS)
- Implement an approach of [storing soil observation data in a GeoPackage](../GPKG), using some of the STA conventions
