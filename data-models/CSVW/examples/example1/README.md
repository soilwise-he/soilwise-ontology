# An example of Soil Data from SOTER Eastern Europe

The startingpoint is a dataset [soveur.csv](./soveur.csv), which has been exported from the [SOTER Eastern Europe dataset](https://data.isric.org/geonetwork/srv/metadata/b1fa4988-b511-48e3-9548-3c48f0a908fa). This database is made available by ISRIC - World Soil Information under a CC-BY-3.0 license.

- The columns have been imported to the third tab and their type has been set
