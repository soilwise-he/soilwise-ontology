# Soilwise ontology

Ontology in the EUSO domain is typically clustered around the following 3 topics. For each of the topics we try to list commonly used ontologies in the European Soil related domains.

## Metadata

Metadata has a long history of standardisation. Various communities have developed metadata model to describe their resources.
Dublin core is a common factor in many metadata standards.

## Soil & land observations

The observation, measurements & samples model of OGC offers a flexible approach to model soil and land observation data, both from the field as from the lab. The soil biology and genomic commonities play a special role, because they largely adopted standards from their domain.

## Products with predicted distribution of soil properties

The spatial and temporal distribution of environmental phenomena are typically predicted using statistical and 

## Parameter estimates derived from indirect observations

- spectroscopy
- pedo transfer functions
- biodiversity & genomic research

## Soil health, derived from (changes in) observed soil properties

## Terminology

Harmonising terminology within or between communities is a typical first aspect in cooperation. The SKOS vocabulairy is a common mechanism to advertise (and link between) terminologies.
