Interactive Terminology for Europe [IATE](https://iate.europa.eu/home) is the EU's terminology management system. It has been used in the EU institutions and agencies since summer 2004 for the collection, dissemination and management of EU-specific terminology. The project was launched in 1999 with the aim of providing a web-based infrastructure for all EU terminology resources, enhancing the availability and standardisation of the information.
